# DataCollection
## Areas
* Semantic segmentation
* Image classification
* Object detection
* Object Recognition
* Domain adaptation
* Image generation
* Image augmentation
* Pose estimation
* Autonomous vehicles
* Denoising
* Super-Resolution
* Object Tracking
* Action Recognition
* Face Recognition
* Depth Estimation
* Optical Character Recognition
* 3D Reconstruction
* Image Retrieval
* Optical Flow Estimation
* Style Transfer
* Image Compression
* Image Captioning
## Strategies
First generate/write vogue queries for these areas\
Then get papers for each of these areas
## How to get papers
* mannuly selection
* search area on google scholar (400 for each area)
* search area on semantic scholar (200 for each area)
* search area on paperswithcodes (200 for each area)

## Data format
Notice that rating for the retrival results from these resourcesare done in the following way:
* 1: not retrived in this resource, but in other resource
* 2: 200< rank <=400
* 3: 100 < rank <= 200
* 4: 40 < rank <= 100
* 5: rank <= 40
And the aggregate are done as follows:
0.3\*data from google scholar + 0.3\*data from semantic scholar + 0.4*data from paperswithcodesÃŸ
